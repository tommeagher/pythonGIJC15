#Prep your machine
Before we meet, you'll need to prepare your personal computer for the class.

##Install Python 2.7
If you're using a Windows PC, [Anthony DeBarros](https://github.com/anthonydb) has written [a fantastic walkthrough](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2014/02/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-8-1/) for getting Python 2.7 installed on your machine.

Here's [a similar tutorial](http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/) if you're on a Mac. And [another for Linux users](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/python2.html).

##A place to write your code
You'll want to have a text editor installed on your machine. I like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I've also used [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), which is free. Anything where you can write code and save it as plain text files will work.

##Manage your Python project environment
After you have Python up and running, you'll also need to install [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html), [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

You also want to install the iPython interactive interpreter. Try it out by running ```pip install ipython```.

##Grab the scripts for the class
It would help if you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), so you can easily clone the repository of code for the class from Github to your local machine and keep track of the changes you make to it over time.

If you don't want to set up git, you can [download a zip file](https://github.com/tommeagher/pythonGIJC15/archive/master.zip) of the class files from Github.

Finally, you'll want to install our [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) by navigating into the folder with the pythonGIJC15 class materials and typing ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
