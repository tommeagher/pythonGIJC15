#Prepping your machine for the class.
First, you'll need to prepare your personal computer for the class.

If you're using a Windows PC, [Anthony DeBarros](https://github.com/anthonydb) has written [a fantastic tutorial](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2014/02/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-8-1/) for getting Python 2.7 installed on your machine.

Here's [a similar tutorial](http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/) if you're on a Mac. And [another for Linux users](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/python2.html).

You'll also need to install setup tools, pip, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper and, finally, our [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
