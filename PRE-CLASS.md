#Prepping your machine for the class.
Before we meet, you'll need to prepare your personal computer for the class.

If you're using a Windows PC, [Anthony DeBarros](https://github.com/anthonydb) has written [a fantastic tutorial](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2014/02/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-8-1/) for getting Python 2.7 installed on your machine.

Here's [a similar tutorial](http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/) if you're on a Mac. And [another for Linux users](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/python2.html).

After you have Python up and running, you'll also need to install [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html), [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and, finally, our [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). It would also be beneficial if you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) as well, so you can fetch the repository of code for the class from Github.
