"""
Strings
"""
# create a string


# print your string. If you're using the interactive interpretor
# (rather than running this script from a saved file), you don't need to type "print"


# get the type


# get the length


# remember that a string is just a series of characters, not a word or a sentence
# so you can "slice" off pieces of a string based on the index of the characters in it.
# Try to slice off the last 5 characters in my_string


# convert it to lowercase


# convert it to uppercase


# convert it to titlecase


# concatenate strings


# split strings


# join a list of strings


# remove a character


# strip whitespace


# removes only leading whitespace chars


# removes only trailing whitespace chars


# I need help remembering what methods my variable has available


# I need help on a specific method



"""
integers
"""
# create an integer


# print your integer


# get the type of your integer


# do some addition



# do some subtraction



# do some multiplication



# do some division



"""
floats
"""
# create float, assign it a value and print it



# divide a float in half


# divide a number in half



"""
Lists
"""
# create a list


# create a list, you can use strings, intergers, variables, etc


# print the list


# print its type


# print its length


# create a list of numbers


# print the first item in the list


# print the last item in the list


#print all items from 4 through the end. We call this slicing.


#print the items from the start to the penultimate


#print the middle 4 items


# add an item to the list and see if it was added



# delete the last item in the list



# set the last value in the list to a variable




"""
Dictionaries
"""
# create an empty dictionary


# add a key called "class_size", whose value is my_product



# add a dictionary key called "nerds" and a value of "at bar"



# call the value of a dictionary for the key "nerds"


"""
Conditionals & Comparisons
"""
# take your list or make a new one, loop through it printing out each value




# create two variables, assign values and compare them








# create two variables, assign one as a number and one as a string and compare them





# if x is greater than y, print my_list
# otherwise, print my_dict








# This barely skims the surface of what you can do in Python, 
# but hopefully this overview will make you comfortable enough to get started.
# exit the program
